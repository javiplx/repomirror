To setup a debian cached repository, the first step is to configure the
repository as done with any other repository. The only step where the
standard procedure changes is that the 'subdir' key is required. The primary
use of this keyword is to map to a different apache webserver <Directory />
directive, which in turns means use distinct URL value for the packages source.

So, it is possible to share the same subdir on multiple repositories, such as
multiple debian suites, or ubuntu base and update repositories. The only
condition is that the url must be the same for each repository to share subdir,
and means that security repositories cannot usually be merged.


The apache configuration required must be generated with reposerver command,
but the repository metadata must be downloaded using repomirror, as with other
repository types.

NOTE : The repository metadata is owned by root user, to avoid uncontrolled
updates under the metadata tree, as could happen if, for example, an apt
client is configured with a component which is not included on mirroring.

To setup a debian cached repository, the first step is to configure the
repository as done with any other repository. The only step where the
standard procedure changes is that the 'subdir' key is required. The primary
use of this keyword is to map to a different apache webserver <Directory />
directive, which in turns means use distinct URL value for the packages source.

So, it is possible to share the same subdir on multiple repositories, such as
multiple debian suites, or ubuntu base and update repositories. The only
condition is that the url must be the same for each repository to share subdir,
and means that security repositories cannot usually be merged.


Once the repository metadata is downloaded, populating the 'dists' directory,
apache webserver must be configured to get access to the upstream sources. And
this goal is achived by setting the proper value for source_url in the apache
configuration.

And the final step is to grant permissions to the webserver user for writing
under the repository tree. The safer way is to manually create the pool
directory, setting ownership to the user that apache webserver run as.

NOTE : Is it possible to run everything with the user of apache, but it is not
recommended to allow uncontrolled updates under the metadata tree, as would
happen if, for example, an apt client is configured with a component which is
not configured for mirroring.

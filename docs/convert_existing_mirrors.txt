Although there are no standard recipe, any already existing mirror can be
migrated into a repomirror configuration.

The most easy case is that of debian derived distros. The parent directory,
up to the 'dists' directory will be used for the destdir keyword, and the
remaining required keywords are the standard deb, url and version (must be
the codename). If architectures or components are not specified, they will
default to all the values defined at Release file.

Yum based repos can go into more complex cases, so the easiest path is to
configure a pure-yum single architecture repository for each one. With this
approach, destdir will be the parent directory of the 'repodata' directory,
and only url must be set to a real value. Keywords version and architectures,
although yet required, are just informative, and depending on the source we
are using, setting usepgp and pkgvflags to False and SKIP_CKSUM can be needed
to successfully run repomirror.

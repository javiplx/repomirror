The utility buildlive is intended to help in system "cloning", by building
a repository with the same package and versions than those present on a
particular running system.

Alghouth is possible to perform this task on a different node, the easiest
operation is within node, being possible to execute it from the unpacked
source directory. Typical usage will involve just executing
./buildlive reponame
althought there are a couple of tasks that should be done in advance. The
very first is to create a configuration file /etc/buildrepo.conf with a
global section , and the second one is to create the top directory used
on that configuration.

If we prefer to run on a different node, we need the original dpkg status
file of the node under cloning, and three extra parameters are required
  - status-file, to point to the local copy of the original dpkg status
  - breed, to indicate the type of system we are cloning (debian/ubuntu)
  - architecture, from the original node

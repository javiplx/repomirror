The configuration files are INI-style ones, and setting up a new mirror means
adding a new section either to the main configuration (/etc/repomirror.conf),
or with a file in the configurations directory (/etc/repomirror.d).


Although in principle any keyword can be used anywhere, it is recommended to
define a 'global' section, whose contents will affect to all the configured
repositories. The values typically defined in this global section are:

destdir   - default top directory for all the mirrored respositories
usegpg    - enable/disable GPG verification of primary metadata files
pkgvflags - define required checks for secondary files (Packages, primary.xml)


Appart from a destdir keyword, there are some othe mandatory values to be
defined in a mirror:

type          - type of mirror. Primary ones are deb & yum, but some subtypes
                are cleated primaryly for yum to allow mirroring of multiple
                architectures for some distributions (Fedora, CentOS)
type          - type of mirror. Primary ones are deb/yum, but subtypes exists)
version       - version to mirror (not required for some repo types)
url           - url for the repository toplevel, without version identification
                can be specified as server, plus optional scheme and base_path

The key 'architectures' holds a list of architectures to mirror, and although
is internally required is optional for some repository types (deb and yum
derived), where defaults to the common architectures (i386 + x86_64/amd64).
In single architecture types as feed and yum, it is still required for
informative purposes, but no selection is done.

Optional keywords, appart from those mentioned for the global section, do
currently only have sense for debian repositories:

components - name of debian components to mirror
subdir     - name of subdirectory for mirror (default is section name)


Finally, the keyword 'filters' can be also specified, and should contain the
names of other keywords that should be used to decide if a single package will
be mirrored or not. This block is very type specific, so a couple of examples
are shown below

type = deb
filters = sections
priorities = standard required important

type = yum
filters = groups
groups = System/Libraries System_Environment/Base User_Interface/X

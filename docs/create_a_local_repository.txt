NOTE : although repository building is mostly independend of mirroring, this
       document assumes you are familiar with the available documentation
       for repomirror.


Configuration files follow the same rules than those for repomirror. They are
ini-style, there is a main one and can be hosted under a .d subdirectory.


The only variable expected in the global section is 'destdir', which has
a similar meaning than for repomirror, and points to the parent directory
of those containing the packages. The directory actually searched for
packages is built by concatenating the repository name to this toplevel
directory.


Definitions of build repositories currently allow much less keywords than
repomirror does. The most important keyword is 'type', and defines the kind
of repository to be built. Three repository types are implemented:
 - deb  - will create a 'simple' debian repository (only Packages file)
 - feed - creates an OpenWrt feed repository (indexes ipk & opk files)
 - yum  - builds a yum compatible repository using createrepo
The keywords 'version' and 'architectures' are also required, although their
values are currently unused.

If 'destdir' is used within the repository definition, it sets the full path
for package search, without appending repository name. Other optional keyword
for deb & feed repositories is 'extensions', which overrides the default file
extensions indexed.


A sample repo building configuration is shown below

[global]
destdir = /home/repomirror

[mybook-oe]
type = feed
version = 1.18
architectures = armv5te

[javiplx]
destdir = /home/in-house/javiplx
type = deb
version = lenny
architectures = i386 amd64

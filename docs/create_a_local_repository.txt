NOTE : although repository building is mostly independend of mirroring, this
       document assumes you are familiar with the available documentation
       for repomirror.


NOTE : version 1.5 only supports feed repositories (aka simple debian)


Configuration files follow the same rules than those for repomirror. They are
ini-style, there is a main one and can be hosted under a .d subdirectory.


The only variable expected in the global section is 'destdir', which has
a similar meaning than for repomirror, and points to the parent directory
of those containing the packages. The directory actually searched for
packages is built by concatenating the repository name to this toplevel
directory.


Definitions of build repositories currently allow much less keywords than
repomirror does. The most important keyword is 'type', and defines the kind
of repository to be built. As for version 1.5, only feed repositories are
supported (aka simple debian).
Keywords 'version' and 'architectures' are also required, although their
values are currently unused.

The list of indexed extensions defaults to opk & ipk for feeds, but can
be modified by defining an optional 'extensions' keyword.
And if 'destdir' is used within the repository definition, it set the full
path for package search, without appending repository name.


A sample repo building configuration is shown below

[global]
destdir = /home/repomirror

[mybook-oe]
type = feed
version = 1.18
architectures = armv5te

[javiplx]
destdir = /home/in-house/javiplx
type = feed
extensions = .deb
version = lenny
architectures = i386 amd64

0) Read configuration (currently infile)
   two sections :  common and release specific (codename at least)

1) Check for destination directory
   exit if not found

NOTE : Revisitar este primer trozo
2) Download Release file and verify options [ actually pre-3 ]

3) Verify options (mainly codename) [ This breaks whatever logic you define ]
   exit if fail
   (re)create tree if success
   issue message (if non quiet)

4) gpgverify _existing_ Release
   if fails, copy downloaded
   if succeed, exit (unless forced)
NOTE : This "simple" logic does not verify the just downloaded one !!!
4 is verify Release, exiting if succeed, then copy downloaded and verify

5) Get list of files to download

  5.1) Verify md5 of Packages*
       if succeed, return [is a continue in this case]
  5.2) DownloadReplace & verify Packages*
       if fails, _exit_ [raise exception??], and remove localcopy
   
6) Filter package list, with minor filters

7) Download packages
  Verify destination, and download if does not exist or fails

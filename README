repomirror is a set of tools intended to manage linux repositories. Handles
the most common package formats (deb/opk, rpm) and repositories (apt, yum).
Is able to partially import external repositories, as well as build custom
repositories, either with local packages or using packages coming from an
external source.

Configuration files are ini style, and the two primary commands are in charge
of syncing local repository (repomirror) and build required metadata files to
construct an exportable repository (buildrepo). Detailed documentation is
available at the docs directory.

There is also a reposerver program, intended to offer the repositories content.
It can work as a pure python webserver on port 8080, but can also be used to
generate a configuration file suitable for apache.

Tested with Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE and OpenWrt feeds.


Advanced functionality
----------------------

Although not completelly polished, besides simple mirroring some advanced
functionality is provided, by mean of different bundled tools

checkmirror - a simple repository update check, usable as nagios plugin

buildlive - tries to construct a repository to fully reproduce packages
    installed in a live server (debian only)

snapshots - allows creation of snapshots of mirrored repositories
